Based on the provided codebase and the definitions of technical capabilities, here is a list of potential technical capabilities that could be inferred from the codebase:

- **Data Storage**: The presence of `values.yaml` files suggests configuration for applications that may involve data storage solutions.
- **CI/CD**: Shell scripts like `install-mq-server-prereqs.sh` and `install-mq-explorer.sh` imply a setup process that could be part of a CI/CD pipeline.
- **Observability**: The script `setup-cluster.sh` includes a command to install Weave Scope, which is a tool for monitoring, visualizing, and managing Docker containers, indicating observability capabilities.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: The `service-nativeha.yaml` and `Chart.yaml` files suggest the use of Helm charts, which are a form of infrastructure as code for Kubernetes.
- **Event Streaming**: The references to IBM MQ in filenames and documents suggest capabilities related to message queuing, which is a form of event streaming.
- **Process Automation**: The automation scripts for installing prerequisites and setting up the environment indicate process automation capabilities.

```markdown
- Data Storage: Relational and no-sql databases, etc.
- CI/CD: Continuous integration and deployment processes.
- Observability: Monitoring and management of the system's state.
- Infrastructure as Code: Defining and deploying infrastructure using code.
- Event Streaming: Handling and processing of streaming data.
- Process Automation: Automating recurring processes for consistency and efficiency.
```

Please note that without explicit evidence of the implementation of these capabilities in the codebase, this list is speculative and based on the filenames and contents of the scripts provided.
