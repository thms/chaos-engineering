Given the provided codebase, we can model the data structure using a UML class diagram. The codebase consists of several arrays that represent different aspects of a collection of documents, including their metadata and content. Below is a UML class diagram that represents the data model of the codebase:

```markdown
```plantuml
@startuml

class Codebase {
    ids: UUID[][]
    distances: double[][]
    embeddings: Embedding[][]
    metadatas: Metadata[][]
    documents: String[][]
    uris: URI[][]
    data: Data[][]
    included: String[]
}

class UUID {
    +String value
}

class Embedding {
    // Attributes related to embeddings (not provided in the context)
}

class Metadata {
    +String author
    +String category
    +String filename
    +String filetype
    +String language
    +String repo
    +String source
}

class URI {
    // Attributes related to URIs (not provided in the context)
}

class Data {
    // Attributes related to data (not provided in the context)
}

Codebase "1" *-- "0..*" UUID : ids
Codebase "1" *-- "0..*" Metadata : metadatas
Codebase "1" *-- "0..*" String : documents
Codebase "1" *-- "0..*" double : distances
Codebase "1" o-- "0..*" Embedding : embeddings
Codebase "1" o-- "0..*" URI : uris
Codebase "1" o-- "0..*" Data : data

This UML class diagram represents the structure of the codebase with the following elements:

- **Codebase**: The main class that encapsulates all the data.
- **UUID**: Represents the unique identifiers for each element in the codebase.
- **Metadata**: Contains metadata information about each document, such as author, category, filename, filetype, language, repository, and source.
- **Embedding**: A placeholder for any embedding information associated with the documents (actual structure not provided in the context).
- **URI**: A placeholder for URI information (actual structure not provided in the context).
- **Data**: A placeholder for additional data (actual structure not provided in the context).

The relationships are depicted with lines connecting the classes, indicating the composition of the `Codebase` class with arrays of other classes or data types. The multiplicities indicate that the `Codebase` can contain zero or more instances of each associated class.

Please note that the actual attributes for `Embedding`, `URI`, and `Data` classes are not provided in the context, so they are represented as placeholders in this diagram.
